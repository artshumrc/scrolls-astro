  This <a target="_blank" href="https://www.edx.org/course/book-scrolls-age-book-harvardx-hum1-2x">free online course</a>, led by Professor Thomas Forrest Kelly, provides an introduction to the making and use of scrolls in the European Middle Ages. Participants in this course will see and examine in detail a number of beautiful objects, and come to understand the thinking of those who chose the scroll format for their texts.
  <br /><br />
  Scrolls in the Age of the Book also features a guided tour of an exhibition on Harvard University's collection of medieval scrolls, held at Houghton Library, Harvard's special collections library, in Spring 2014. Each scroll featured in the exhibit has been fully digitized by Harvard's Preservation Services division, and participants will have the opportunity to interact with them in unprecedented fashion using Mirador, a state-of-the-art image viewer developed by Harvard and Stanford Universities.
