contents: "Chronicle of the genealogy of the kings of England to 1458. Begins with the antediluvian portion of the chronicle attributed to Peter of Poitiers. Afterwards are traced the genealogies of English kings to Edward, Prince of Wales, son of Henry VI, from Noah through Boerinus and Woden, and from Rollo, and of Welsh princes from Noah through Brutus. In parallel columns are (a) the genealogy of Christ, followed by the series of popes to Pius II; (b) the succession of British kings to Careticus; and (c) the succession of Roman kings and (selected) consuls, followed by emperors from Julius Caesar to Frederic IV. Similar to Harley Roll T. 12 and Add. MS. 24342."
