# Medieval Scrolls Astro
- The [Medieval Scrolls Digital Archive](https://medievalscrolls.com/) is a comprehensive resource for research on scrolls in the Middle Ages. The website was originally designed as a supplementary resource for Tom Kelly's HarvardX course **Scrolls in the Age of the Book**, which provided an introduction to the making and use of scrolls in the European Middle Ages. In its first iteration it was a Wordpress + Angular application. This project is a redesign of the website using Astro, a static site generator.
- Data was migrated from Wordpress to Astro using `wordpress-export-to-markdown` (see `/migration` folder for details).
- The data source for the Astro application is stored in Google Sheets and transformed into JSON (`data/scrolls_master_list.json`) using [OpenSheet](https://github.com/benborgers/opensheet#readme) in `scrape_sheets/scrape_sheet.py`. A Github Actions workflow (`update_scrolls_data`) on a cron job is used to update the JSON file in the repository. `enhance_sheets/enhance_sheets.py` was used to add additional metadata to the Sheet on a one-time basis.
- Running `npm run build` will rebuild the Pagefind index. [`pagefind`](https://pagefind.app/) is a CloudCannon package used for static search functionality. We are currently using their Default UI, which has some limitations, such as not being able to have a `null` search (so there are no results until the user starts typing). We will eventually move to using their Modular UI, but it is still in beta and presented other challenges as of June 2024.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

- The Astro app is in `src`.
- Astro components (or Vue, React, Svelte, etc - Astro can wrap any of them) live in `src/components`.
- We are using Typescript; the type definitions are in `src/types`.
- Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name. `scrolls` has an index page (for the search) and a dynamic route for each scroll at `[...slug].astro`.
- Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
- The built application is output to the `dist/` directory.
